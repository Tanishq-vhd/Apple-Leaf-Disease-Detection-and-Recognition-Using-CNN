# Apple-Leaf-Disease-Detection-and-Recognition-Using-CNN
Apple trees are vulnerable to various leaf diseases that reduce yield and quality. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify apple leaf diseases from images, enabling early detection, accurate diagnosis, and smarter crop management for sustainable farming.
